Main Research Questions
1.Can we project the number of men’s and women’s beds needed for the next Hypothermia season?
2. Can we project the number of beds for next year by shelter?
3. Can we project the number of beds per shelter used correlated with bad weather (i.e. low temperatures, high snow and precipitation/high temperatures during summer)?
   We will Will try out projecting 1 month into future
4. Do eviction numbers correlate with shelter stay numbers?
